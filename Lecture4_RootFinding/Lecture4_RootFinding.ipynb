This subinterval is taken as the interval $[a,b]$ used for the next iteration. This process continues until the resulting midpoint $x$ of the current interval is sufficiently close to 0.  \n",

A corollary of this is that the outcome of bisection (and of local methods in general) is sensitive to the starting point chosen by the user, here the values for $a$ and $b$.\n",
