The file 'baseball_stats.csv' contains information on more than 18,000 players that have played in the US baseball league MLB at some point. The data includes the name, height and weight of a player, moreover its \"handedness\" (whether he bats with his left or right hand or both), his batting average (the percentage of at-bats in which he recorded a hit) and the number of home runs.\n",

We can use a t-test to check the hypothesis that both groups come from the same population, i.e. that there is no systematic difference and all observed difference is due to sampling. Use the **ttest_ind** function in Scipy's **scipy.stats** module to compute a t-statistic under the null hypothesis\n",
